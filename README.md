# 🤖 Synthesizer (React Canvas Experiment)

Made as a personal test project to help me get more comfortable with React. A simple landing page that features an animated, interactive **hexagon grid background** rendered on an HTML `<canvas>`. As the user moves the mouse, nearby hexagons subtly shift and glow — adds a dynamic and modern aesthetic and feel. 
Tested mainly to work on PC.
